## 🌟 Coding Standards
This project adheres to the following coding principles:

- Validation: All HTML5 and CSS3 files are validated using the W3C Validator.
- Separation of Concerns: Styles and scripts are external files linked to the HTML. Inline styles or embedded scripts are not used.
- Accessibility: Designed for usability by users with visual impairments, including those with color blindness. Tested with color simulation tools (e.g., Protanopia, Deuteranopia).
- Responsive Design: Achieved with Flexbox and Media Queries for adaptability to various screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5: Semantic and accessible markup.
- CSS3: Styling and layout.
- JavaScript: For dynamic interactivity.
- AJAX: Used for dynamic features like the chatbox and login system

## 📋 Form Validation
The website includes advanced form validation written in JavaScript (without jQuery), ensuring real-time feedback for users. The following rules are enforced:

1. Name: Cannot be empty.
2. Date of Birth: Must follow the format dd/mm/yyyy and be a valid date (if provided).
3. Username: At least six characters long.
4. Password: At least 12 characters long, including:
     - One uppercase letter
     - One lowercase letter
     - One digit
     - One special character (`_-;:!?./*&$`)
5. Email: Must be a valid email address.
   
JavaScript validates fields dynamically, and the form cannot be submitted until all criteria are met.

## 🔄 Dynamic Features
- Login System: Uses AJAX to dynamically validate credentials via the `login.py` server script.
- Chatbox: Powered by AJAX to enable real-time messaging with JSON responses.

## 🎨 Accessibility
To ensure accessibility:

- Color Blindness: The design is tested for compatibility with Protanopia, Deuteranopia, Tritanopia, and other conditions.
- Fallbacks: If JavaScript is disabled, users are notified using the `<noscript>` tag.
